        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hello again! I'm Amanda, a passionate software engineer who loves to play video games and develop them! I want my work to make an impact on others. I enjoy building projects that solve real world problems and provide novel innovative solutions. Some of my focus areas are large language model security, cybersecurity, and interactive educational games.</p>  
        <p> When I am not coding, you will find me playing video games, reading, or going on a hike. Although, I do enjoy exploring new technologies and always improving my grasp on computer science. I belive in lifelong learning and I strive to develop skills that will help me both in academic and professional pursuits.</p>
